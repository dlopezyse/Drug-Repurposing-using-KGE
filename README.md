## Drug Repurposing using Knowledge Graph Embeddings 💊

Drug repurposing methods can identify already approved drugs to treat them efficiently, reducing development costs and time. At the same time, knowledge graph embedding techniques can encode biological information in a single structure that allows users to operate relationships, extract information, learn connections, and make predictions to discover potential new relationships between existing drugs and vector-borne diseases.

In this [App](https://dr-using-kge.streamlit.app/), we compare seven knowledge graph embedding models (TransE, TransR, TransH, UM, DistMult, RESCAL, and ERMLP) applied to Drug Repurposing Knowledge Graph (DRKG), analyzing their predictive performance over seven different vector-borne diseases (dengue, chagas, malaria, yellow fever, leishmaniasis, filariasis, and schistosomiasis), measuring their embedding quality and external performance against a ground-truth.

This project is based on the paper **[Drug Repurposing Using Knowledge Graph Embeddings with a Focus on Vector-Borne Diseases: A Model Comparison](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-40942-4_8)** as developed by [Diego López Yse](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lopezyse/) and [Diego Torres](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ditorres/) for the Conference on Cloud Computing, Big Data & Emerging Topics 2023.

You can find here the data and code used for developing and evaluating the predictive models.

### Repository structure

- **[streamlit_app.py](streamlit_app.py)**: outputs a drug ranking prediction based on a chosen disease and embedding model.
- **[embedding_models](embedding_models)**: includes the outcomes of predictions on specific diseases generated by trained embedding models using the DRKG dataset.
- **[train_embeddings.py](train_embeddings.py)**: trains an embedding model on a given dataset. Predictions can be performed on the results of this training.
- **[predictions.py](predictions.py)**: performs predictions on the already trained embedding models. 

### Environment
The project was developed using Visual Studio Code 1.84 with Python 3.10.13
